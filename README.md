# SOLAREX
Solarex is a deep learning project that explores Vision Transformer (ViT)-based architectures for solar flare prediction using solar imaging data.
The goal is to model long-range spatial dependencies in solar active regions and improve flare forecasting performance compared to traditional CNN-based approaches.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository
2. Create virtual environment:
